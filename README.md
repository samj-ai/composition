# composition

Develop and test compositional generalization abilities in nn's  

This libary consists of sandboxes / benchmark tasks to evaluate compositional generalization in nn's.

 - ARC-AGI
 - ARC-AGI-2
 - Szpakowski patterns
 - SRaven's matrices
 - BBH

Moreover, here I also experiment with dimensions along with transformers and training can be modified to facilitate compositional generalization (and more generally, data efficiency).

Some context in a writeup [here](https://samj-ai.github.io/2025/03/26/ARC-AGI.html).
